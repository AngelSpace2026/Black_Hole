Algorithm Black_Hole_34 includes algorithms such as:

    Lempel-Ziv-Welch (LZW): LZW is a dictionary-based compression algorithm that works by replacing strings of characters with references to a dictionary containing previously seen strings. It is commonly used in formats such as GIF and TIFF.

    Burrows-Wheeler Transform (BWT): The BWT rearranges the characters in the input data to improve compressibility by grouping similar characters together. It is often used in combination with other algorithms, such as the Move-To-Front transform and Run-Length encoding, to achieve compression.

    Arithmetic Coding: Arithmetic coding is a more advanced form of data compression that uses fractional numbers to represent variable-length sequences of symbols. It can achieve better compression ratios than simpler algorithms like Huffman encoding, but is also more computationally intensive.

    Delta Encoding: Delta encoding works by encoding the difference between successive elements in a data stream. It is particularly effective for compressing data with a high degree of similarity between adjacent values.

Run-length encoding (RLE) is a simple lossless data compression algorithm that works by reducing the size of repetitive sequences in a data stream. In RLE, consecutive occurrences of the same data value are stored as a single value and a count of how many times it repeats. This can significantly reduce the size of data with long sequences of repeating values.

Based on the use of RLE in your code, it is likely that this algorithm is applying run-length encoding to compress data. The RLE algorithm typically works in two main phases:

    Compression: During the compression phase, the algorithm scans the input data and identifies sequences of repeating values. It then replaces these sequences with a single value representing the data and a count of how many times it repeats. This compressed output is usually smaller in size than the original data.

    Decompression: During the decompression phase, the algorithm reverses the compression process by expanding the run-length encoded data back into the original uncompressed form. This allows the original data to be recovered without losing any information.
